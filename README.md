## Client APP

This project is designed to work with a companion iOS app. The app:
- Uses RTVI function calls to share the user's current location with the LLM.
- Receives restaurant location suggestions from the LLM and opens Google Maps to display the location.

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the iOS app, refer to [this link](./client/ios/README.md).
